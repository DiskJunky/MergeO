# MergeO
Merge Objects

This library takes two objects of the same type and performs a merge based on the supplied values within the object graph. Each merge is customizable and the merge behaviour can be overridden.

The primary use cases for this library are when you have a current object state and you need to merge in partial new data (e.g., if the user submitted new details or updates but didn't have to fill out the full details).
